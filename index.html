				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<h2>I'm Alison Bartsch</h2>
				<p> MEEP. I'm a PhD  student in the Mechanical Engineering department at CMU advised by Prof. Amir Barati Farimani. I am interested in using machine learning for complex robotic tasks, such as grasping and manipulation, with the goal of creating robotic systems that are more generalizable and robust to uncertainty. This website is a bit of a fun personal project to explore website design, so feel free to explore!</p>
				<!-- <p> INSERT WITH KNITTING FIXED </p> -->

				<!-- I received my bachelor of science degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University in 2021. Outside of the lab, I enjoy baking, reading, knitting, painting, plants and playing soccer.  -->

				<!-- <p>I'm a Stanford senior majoring in Aeronautics and <br> Astronautics. I'm originally from St. Thomas, US <br> Virgin Islands. 
					I love robotics, space exploration, <br> baking, cooking and drawing/doodling! Learning how <br> to code this website has
					been a really fun way to <br> merge some of my technical skills with my more <br> creative ones, so please explore!</p> -->
