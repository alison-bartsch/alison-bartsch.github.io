				<h2>I'm Alison Bartsch</h2>
				<!-- <p> I'm a PhD  student in the Mechanical Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Professor Amir Barati Farimani. I am interested in using machine learning for complex robotic tasks, such as grasping and manipulation, with the goal of creating robotic systems that are more generalizable and robust to uncertainty. I received my bachelor of science degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University in 2021. Outside of the lab, I enjoy baking, reading, knitting, painting, plants and playing soccer. This website is a bit of a fun personal project to explore website design!</p> -->

				<!-- <p>I'm a Stanford senior majoring in Aeronautics and <br> Astronautics. I'm originally from St. Thomas, US <br> Virgin Islands. 
					I love robotics, space exploration, <br> baking, cooking and drawing/doodling! Learning how <br> to code this website has
					been a really fun way to <br> merge some of my technical skills with my more <br> creative ones, so please explore!</p> -->
