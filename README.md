Personal Website!


### Website Goals:
- have short bio on home page
- have a page about research projects
- have a page talking about interesting robotics/RL publications
- have a page about baking projects/recipes
- have a page about artwork
- have a page about knitting


### Website Ideas Brainstorm:
- Have the opening home page be a split screen with black & white images relevant to my interests
- Cat art idea: have the original picture & when you mouse over it, it replaces a small circle of the image revealing the drawing I made
- Try to incorporate by line-drawing style doodles for many things
- Maybe have the bottom bar w/ contact information be black w/ white letters
- Cat art Idea:
    - have the original picture & when you mouse over it replaces a small circle of the image revealing the vector drawing I made
- Wave scrolling: have vector art that kinda looks like the ocean & as you scroll the top section expands to a whole page that color, then contracts, then the next section expands & contracts, etc.
