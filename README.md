Personal Website!


### Website Goals:
- have short bio on home page
- have a page about ASL research/resume
- have a page about fun coding projects (solar system simulator, this website, etc.)
- have a page about baking projects/recipes
- have a page about artwork


### Website Ideas Brainstorm:
- Have the opening home page be split screen (white on left & grey tone on right, or something like that)
- Have the left be a slide show of images pertaining to different things about me (Aero/Astro Major, Research, Fun Projects, Baking Experiments)
- Or have the left be a picture of me & the right be a short bio
- Try to incorporate by line-drawing style doodles for many things
- Maybe have the bottom bar w/ contact information be black w/ white letters
- Maybe add the personal logo you created in ME 102 a year ago?
- Cat art Idea:
    - have the original picture & when you mouse over it replaces a small circle of the image revealing the vector drawing I made
- Wave scrolling:
    - have vector art that kinda looks like the ocean & as you scroll the top section expands to a whole page that color, then contracts, then the next section expands & contracts, etc.
